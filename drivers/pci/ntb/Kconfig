	  ntbeth is a Linux network driver that uses NTB PCI-E Link as
	  point-to-point link between two electrically separated
	  systems. The driver registers itself as Ethernet driver into
	  the Linux TCP/IP stack.  Primary purpose of this driver is to
	  show how NTB link can be used as connection link between two
	  systems to exchange data using NTB provided Windows into
	  remote system and use door bells to provide asynchronous
	  notifications to remote system

	  If you are building the kernel for a Jasper Forest or Jaketown
	  system say Y

	  If unsure, say N
